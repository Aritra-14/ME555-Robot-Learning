# Implementation Details: 

# Next Frame Prediction on Moving MNIST dataset: 

- Step 1: Import the file Next_Frame_Video_Prediction_on_Moving_MNIST_with_Convolutional_LSTMs.ipynb to Colab. 

- Step 2: Run all the Blocks. 

# Next Frame Prediction on Glitch White Circle: 

- Step 1: Import the file Pix2PixHD_Next_Frame_in_Sequence_Prediction_a.ipynb to Colab. 

- Step 2: Download the video (from my Google Drive) on which we predict future frames: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10m9-SgjHsE8JBdE0RYg_H6ahXeSA4d2B/view?usp=share_link. Import this to Colab. 

- Step 3: Run the Blocks. (All blocks are commented in the .ipynb file.) 

- Step 4: Visualizations for some predicted videos at epochs 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 can be downloaded from my Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KMEGrFkW95-NaRLnr9uJLir_B2D201MS?usp=share_link 

# Next Frame Prediction on Self Video: 

- Step 1: Import the file Pix2PixHD_Next_Frame_in_Sequence_Prediction_b.ipynb to Colab. 

- Step 2: Download the video (from my Google Drive) on which we predict future frames: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tG4SG5VbjhuZmdKx4ZH58GaIkHTAmHZq/view?usp=share_link. Import this to Colab. **You can use any other video of your choice!
**
- Step 3: Run the Blocks. (All blocks are commented in the .ipynb file.) 

- Step 4: Visualizations for some predicted videos at epochs 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 can be downloaded from my Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hfL-T1ORg9dfCLzwqEC9ASA7Th7ZBLEP?usp=share_link
